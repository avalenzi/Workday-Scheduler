# Workday-Scheduler
In this project I created a work day scheduler with Bootstrap and moment.js that allows you to:
Save important things/ tasks you need to get done within the time frame
Display the saved text no matter if you close out the tab
Knows the time and day:

Grey = Past
Red = Present
Green = future

The Scheduler displays a set of events, appointments, or tasks.
Each timeblock contains an input field and save button.
Clicking a timeblock's "Save" button stores the input text in local storage.
